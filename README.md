# Machine Learning Models ðŸ¤–ðŸ“–

## Overview

This repository contains my machine learning models from my various assignments/ mini projects, organized into subdirectories for each task. Each subdirectory includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) showcasing the implementation and results of the assignment.
- A `README.md` file providing a detailed explanation of the task, approach, and findings.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my progress and understanding of various machine learning concepts and techniques through practical assignments.

## Repository Structure

```plaintext
ðŸ“‚ ML-Models-Repository
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Fraud detection 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Fraud_detection.ipynb
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Content
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ transcribinator.ipynb
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

##These Include

1. **Fraud Detection**
   - Task: Create a prediction Model for fraudulent transactions
   - Focus Areas: Used RandomForestClassifier and ensemble method with early stopping for this.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/PhoenixAlpha23/ML-models.git](https://github.com/PhoenixAlpha23/ML-models)
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired assignment folder:
   ```bash
   cd Fraud detection
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and results:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Fraud_detection.ipynb
   ```

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (specified in each notebook or `requirements.txt`)

Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Plans

- Add more assignments covering advanced topics.
- Incorporate detailed visualizations and discussions for each task.
- Implement additional metrics and benchmarks to evaluate models.

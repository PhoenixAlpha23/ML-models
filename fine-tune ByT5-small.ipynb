A provision giving a right to the sevayats to reside in the premises dedicated to the idol for the purpose of carrying on the daily and periodical worship and festivals does not detract from the absolute character of a dedication to the idol.

Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, (B. Sen, with him) for respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in the petition for special leave. 1953. November 16. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J.-This is an appeal on a certificate under article 133(1) of the Constitution from a judgment and decree passed by the Appellate Bench of the High Court of Calcutta, modifying on appeal the judgment and decree passed by Mr. Justice Bose on the original side of that court. One Dwarka Nath Ghose was the owner of considerable moveable and immoveable properties. On the 10th June, 1891, he made and published his last will and testament whereby he dedicated to this family idol Shree Shree Iswar Sridhar Jew his two immoveable properties, to wit, premises No. 41 and No. 40/1. Grey Street in the city of Calcutta. He appointed his two sons Rajendra and Jogendra executors of Ms will and provided that his second wife Golap Sundari and the two sons Rajendra and jogendra should perform the seva of the deity and on their death their heirs and successors would be entitled to perform the seva. Dwarka Nath died on the 16th March, 1892, leaving him surviving his widow Golap Sundari and his two sons Rajendra and Jogendra. On the 19th July, 1899, Rajendra made and published his last will and, testament whereby he confirmed the dedication made by Dwarka Nath with regard to premises Nos. 41 and 40/1 Grey Street and appointed his brother Jogendra the sole executor thereof. He died on the 31st January,1900, and Jogendra obtained on the 24th April, 1900,. probate of his said will. Probate of the will of Dwarka Nath was also obtained by jogendra on the 31st August, 1909. On the 4th September 1909, Bhupendra, Jnanendra. and Nagendra, then a minor, the three sons of Rajendra filed a suit, being Suit No. 969 of 1909,on the original side of the High Court at Calcutta against Jogendra, Golap Sundari and Padma Dassi, the widow of Sidheswar, another son of Rajendra, for the construction of the wills of Dwarka Nath and Rajendra, for partition and other reliefs. The idol was not made a party to this suit. The said suit was compromised and on the 24th November, 1910, a consent decree was passed, whereby jogendra and Golap Sundari gave up their rights to the sevayatship and Bhupendra, Jnanendra and Nagendra became the sevaits of the idol, a portion of the premises No. 41 Grey Street was ;allotted to the branch of Rajendra and the remaining portion was allotted to jogendra absolutely and in consideration of a sum of Rs. 6,500 to be paid to the plaintiffs, jogendra was declared entitled absolutely to the premises No. 40/1 Grey Street. The portions allotted to Jogendra were subsequently numbered 40/2-A Grey Street and the portion of the premises No. 41 Grey Street allotted to the branch of Rajendra was subsequently numbered 41-A Grey Street. Jogendra died on the 5th August, 1911, leaving a will whereby he appointed his widow Sushilabala the executrix thereof. She obtained probate of the will on the 6th August, 1912. Disputes arose between Bhupendra, jnanendra and Nagendra, the sons of Rajendra, and one Kedar Nath Ghosh was appointed arbitrator to settle those disputes. The arbitrator made his award dated the 12th October, 1920, whereby he allotted premises No. 41-A Grey Street, exclusively to Nagendra as his share of the family properties. Nagendra thereafter executed several mortgages of the said premises. The first mortgage was created by him in favour of Snehalata Dutt on the 19th May, 1926. The second mortgage was executed on the 4th June, 1926, and the third mortgage on the 22nd February, 1927. On the 23rd February, 1927, Nagendra executed a deed of settlement of the said premises by which he appointed his wife Labanyalata and his wife's brother Samarendra Nath Mitter trustees to carry out the directions therein contained and in pursuance of the deed of settlement he gave up possession of the said premises in favour of the trustees. Snehalata Dutt filed in the year 1929 a suit, being Suit No. 1042 of 1929, against Nagendra, the trustees under the said deed of settlement and the puisne mortgagees, for realisation of the mortgage security,. A consent decree was passed in the said suit on the 9th September, 1929. Nagendra died in June, 1931, and the said premises were ultimately put up for sale in execution of the mortgage decree and were purchased on the 9th December, 1936, by Hari Charan Dutt, Hari Pada Dutt and Durga Charan Dutt for a sum of Rs. 19,000. A petition made by the purchasers on the 12th January, 1937, for setting aside the sale was rejected by the court on the 15th March, 1937. Haripada Dutt -died on the 3rd June, 1941, leaving him surviving his three sons, Pashupati Nath Dutt, Shambhunath Dutt and Kashinath Dutt, the appellants before us. Haricharan Dutt conveyed Ms one third share in the premises to them on the 4th March,1944, and Durga Charan Dutt conveyed his one-third share to them on the 3rd May, 1946. They thus became entitled to the whole of the premises which had been purchased at the auction sale held on the 9th December, 1936. On the 19th July, 1948, the family idol of Dwarka Nath, Sree Sree Iswar Sridhar Jew, by its next friend Debabrata Ghosh, the son of Nagendra, filed the suit, out of which the present appeal arises, against the appellants as, also against Susilabala and the two sons of Jogendra by her, amongst others, for a declaration that the premises Nos. 41- A and 40/2-A Grey Street, were its absolute properties and for possession thereof, for a declaration that the consent decree dated the 24th November, 1910, in Suit No. 969 of 1909 and the award dated the 12th October, 1920, and the dealings made by the heirs of jogendra and/or Rajendra relating to the said premises or any of them purporting to affect its rights in the said premises were invalid and inoperative in law and not binding on it, for an account of the dealings with the said premises, for a scheme of management of the debutter properties and for its worship, for discovery, receiver, injunction and costs. Written statements were filed by the appellants and by Susilabala and the two sons of Jogendra denying the claims of the idol and contending inter alia that there was no valid or absolute dedication of the suit properties I to the idol and that the said premises had been respectively acquired by them by adverse possession and that the title of the idol thereto had been extinguished. The said suit was heard by Mr. Justice Bose who declared the premises No. 41-A Grey Street to be the absolute property of the idol and made the other declarations in favour of the idol as prayed for. The idol was declared entitled to possession of the said premises with mesne profits for three years prior to the institution of the suit till delivery of possession, but was ordered to pay as a condition for recovery of possession of the said premises a sum of Rs. 19,000 to the appellants with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum from the 19th July, 1945, till payment or till the said sum was deposited in court to the credit of the suit. The learned judge however dismissed the suit of the idol in regard to the premises No. 40/2-A Grey Street as, in his opinion, Sushilabala as executrix to her husband's estate and her two sons had acquired title to the said premises by adverse possession and the title of the idol thereto had been extinguished. The appellants filed on the 18th August, 1950, an appeal against this judgment being Appeal No. 118 of 1950. The idol filed on the 20th November, 1950, cross-objections against the decree for Rs. 19,000 and interest thereon as also the dismissal of the suit in regard to the premises No. 40/2-A Grey Street. The appeal, and the cross-objections came on for hearing before Harries C. J. and S. N. Banerjee J., who delivered judgment on the 5th March, 1951, dismissing the said appeal and allowing the cross-objection in regard to Rs. 19,000 filed by the idol against the appellants. In regard however to the cross-objection relating to premises No. 40/2-A Grey Street which was directed against Sushilabala and the two sons of jogendra the learned judges held- that the cross-objection against the co-respondents was not maintainable and dismissed the same with costs. The appellants filed on the 31st May, 1951, an appli- cation for leave to prefer an appeal to this court against the said judgment and decree of the High Court at Calcutta. A certificate under article 133(1) of the Constitution was granted on the 4th June, 1951, and the High Court admitted the appeal finally on the 6th August, 1951. On the 22nd November, 1951, the idol applied to the High Court for leave to file cross-objections against that part of the judgment and decree of the High Court,which dismissed its claims with regard to the premises No.40/2-A Grey Street. The High Court rejected the said application stating that there was no rule allowing cross-objections in the Supreme Court.The said cross-objections were however printed as additional record, By an order made by this court on the 24th May, 1953, the petition of the idol for filing cross-objections in this court was allowed to be treated as a petition for special leave to appeal against that part of the decree which was against it, subject to any question as to limitation. The appeal as also the petition for special leave to appeal mentioned above came on for hearing and final disposal before us. The appeal was argued but so far as the petition for special leave to appeal was concerned the parties came to an agreement whereby the idol asked for leave to withdraw the petition on certain terms recorded between the parties. The petition for special leave was therefore allowed to be withdrawn and no objection now survives in regard to the decree passed by the trial court dismissing the idol's claim to the premises, No. 40/2-A Grey Street. The appeal is concerned only with the premises No. 41-A Grey Street. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the, dedication of the premises NO. 41 Grey Street made by Dwarka Nath under the terms of his will was a. partial dedication, and that his sons Rajendra and jogendra and his widow Golap Sundari, who were appointed sevayats of the idol were competent to deal with premises No. 41 Grey Street after making the due provision for the idol as they purported to do by the terms of settlement, dated the 24th November, 1910. It was further contended that Nagendra, by -virtue of the award dated the 12th October, 1920, claimed to be absolutely entitled to the premises No. 41-A Grey Street and that his possession of the said premises thereafter became adverse which adverse possession continued for upwards of 12 years extinguishing the right of the idol to the said premises. The first contention of the appellants is clearly un- tenable on the very language of the will of Dwarka Nath. Clause 3 of the said will provided \\\"With a view to provide a permanent habitation for the said deity, I do by means of this will, dedicate the aforesaid immovable property the said house No. 41 Grey Street together with land thereunder to the said Sri Sri Issur Sridhar Jew. With a view to provide for the expenses of his daily (and) periodical Sheba and festivals, etc. The 3 1/2 Cattahs (three and half Cattahs) of rent free land more or less that I have -on that very Grey Street No. 40/1.......his also I dedicate to the Sheba of the said Sri Sri Sridhar Jew Salagram Sila Thakur. On my demise none of my heirs and representatives shall ever be competent to take the income of the said land No. 40/1 and spend (the same)for household expenses. If there be any surplus left after defraying the Debsheba expenses the same shall be credited to the said Sridhar Jew Thakur's fund and with the amount so deposited repairs, etc; from time to time will be effected to the said house No. 41 with a view to preserve it and the taxes etc., in respect of the said two properties will be paid. . . ...... For the purpose of the carrying on the daily (and) periodical sheba and the festivals, etc. of the said Sri Issur Sridhar Jew Salagram Sila Thakur my said ,second wife Srimati Golap Moni Dasi, and 1st Sriman Rajendara Nath and 2nd, Sriman Jogendra Nath Ghose born of the womb of my first wife on living in the said house No. 41 Grey Street dedicated by me shall properly and agreeably to each other perform the sheba. etc., of the said Sri Sri Issur Sridhar Jew Salagram Sila Thakur and on the death of my said two sons their representatives, successors and heirs shall successively perform the sheba in the aforesaid manner and the executors appointed by this will of mine having got the said two properties registered in the Calcutta Municipality in the name of the said Sri Sri Issur Sridhar Jew Thakur shall pay the municipal taxes, etc.' and shall take the municipal bills in his name. None of my representatives heirs, successors, executors, administrators or assigns shall have any manner of interest in or right to the said two debutter properties and no one shall ever be competent to give away or effect sale, mortgage or in respect of the said two properties nor shall the said two properties, be sold on account of the debts of any one.\\\" It is quite true,that a dedication may be either absolute or partial. The property may be given out and out to the idol, or it may be subjected to a charge in favour of the idol. \\\"The question whether the idol itself shall be considered the true beneficiary, subject to a charge in favour of the heirs or specified relatives of the testator for their upkeep, or that, on the other hand, these heirs shall be considered the true beneficiaries of the property, subject to a charge for the upkeep, worship and expenses of the idol, is a question which can only be settled by a conspectus of the entire provisions of the will\\\": Pande Har Narayan v. Surja Kunwari(1). What we find here in clause 3 of the will is an absolute dedication of the premises No. 41 Grey Street to the idol as its permanent habitation with only the right given to the sevayats to reside in the said premises for the purposes of carrying on the daily and periodical seva and the festivals, etc., of the deity. The said premises are expressly declared as dedicated to the deity. They are to be registered in the municipal records in the name of the deity, the municipal bills have got to be taken also in his name and none of the (1) [1921] L. R. 48 I. A. 143, 145, 146., testator's representatives, heirs, successors, executors, administrators or assigns is to have any manner of interest in or right to the said premises or is to be competent to give away or effect sale, mortgage, etc., of the said premises. There is thus a clear indication of the intention of the testator to absolutely dedicate the said premises to the deity and it is impossible to urge that there was a partial dedication of the premises to the deity. The only thing which was urged by Shri N. C. Chatterjee in support of his contention was that the right to reside in the premises was given to the sevayats and that according to him detracted from the absolute character of the dedication. This argument however cannot avail the appellants. It was observed by Lord Buckmaster in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Gnanendra Nath Das v. Surendra Nath Das (1): \\\"In that case it is provided that the shebait for the time being shall be entitled to reside with his family in the said dwelling-house, but the dwelling-house itself is the place specially set apart for the family idols to which specific reference is made in the will, and in their Lordships' opinion the gift is only a perfectly reasonable arrangement to secure that the man in whose hands the supervision of the whole estate is vested should have associated with his duties the right to reside in this named dwelling place.\\\" The first contention of the appellants therefore fails and we hold that the dedication of the premises No. 41 Grey, Street to the idol was an absolute dedication. As regards the second contention, viz., the adverse possession of Nagendra, it is to be noted that under the terms of clause 3 of the will of Dwarka Nath the representatives, successors and heirs of his two sons Rajendra and Jogendra were successively to perform the seva in the manner therein mentioned and Nagendra was one of the heirs and legal representatives Of Rajendra. He was no doubt a minor on the 24th November, 1910, when the terms of settlement were arrived at between the parties to the suit No. 969 of (1) (1920) 24 C.W.N. 1926 at p. 1030. 1909. His two elder brothers Jnanendra and Bhupendra were declared to be the then sevayats, but a right was reserved to Nagendra to join with them as a sevayat on, his attaining majority. So far as Nagendra is concerned there is a clear finding of fact recorded by Mr. Justice Bose on a specific issue raised in that behalf, viz, \\\"Did Nagendra act as shebait of the plaintiff deity under the wills of Dwarka Nath Ghosh and Rajendra Nath Ghosh ?\\\" that he did act as such shebait and that his possession of the premises No. 41A Grey Street was referable to possession on behalf of the idol, This finding was not challenged in the appeal court and it is too late to challenge the same before us. If Nagendra was thus a sevayat of the idol it could not be urged that his possession could in any manner whatever be adverse to the idol and his dealings with the said premises in the manner he purported to do after the 12th October, 1920, could not be evidence of any adverse possession against the idol. The position of the sevayat and the effect of his dealings with the property dedicated to the idol has been expounded by Rankin C.J. in Surendrakrishna Ray v. Shree Shree Ishwar Bhubaneshwari Thakurani (1) :- \\\"But, in the present case, we have to see whether the possession of two joint shebaits becomes adverse to the idol when they openly claim to divide the property between them. The fact of their possession is in accordance with the idol's title, and the question is whether the change made by them, in the intention with which they hold, evidenced by an application of the rents and profits to their own purposes and other acts, extinguishes the idol's right. I am quite unable to hold that it does, because such a change of inten- tion can only be brought home to the idol by means of the shebait's knowledge and the idol can only react to it by the shebait. Adverse possession,in such circumstances is a notion almost void of content. True, any heir or perhaps any descendant of the founder can bring a suit. against the shebaits on the idol's behalf and, in the present case, it may be said that the acts of the shebaits must have I been notorious in the family. (1) (I 933) 60 Cal 54 at 7 7 But such persons have no legal duty to protect the endowment and, until the shebait is removed or controlled by the court, he alone can act for the idol.\\\" We are in perfect accord with the observations made by Rankin C.J. If a shebait by acting contrary to the terms of his appointment or in breach of his duty as such shebait could claim adverse possession of the dedicated property against the idol it would be putting a premium on dishonesty and breach of duty on his part and no property which is dedicated to an idol would ever be safe. The shebait for the time being is the only person competent to safeguard the interests of the idol, his possession of the dedicated property is the possession of the idol whose sevait he is, and no dealing -of his with the property dedicated to the idol could afford the basis of a claim by him for adverse possession of the property against the idol. No shebait can, so long as he continues to be the sevait, ever claim adverse possession against the idol. Neither Nagendra nor the appellants who derive their title from the auction sale held on the 9th December, 1936, could therefore claim to have perfected their title to the premises No. 41-A Grey Street by adverse possession. The second contention of the appellants also therefore fails. The further contention urged on behalf of the appellants in regard to the disallowance of the sum of Rs. 19,000 by the appeal court could not be and was not seriously pressed before us and does not require any consideration. The result therefore is that the appeal fails and must stand dismissed with costs. Appeal dismissed. Agent for the appellant : P. K. Chatterice.

M.B. Sindhu Shastry, Advocate for Sri N. Subba Shastry, Advocate) **** This Regular First Appeal is filed under Order 41 Rule 1 R/w Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, against the judgment and decree dated:07.01.2006 passed in O.S.No.195/2002 on the file of the Principal Civil Judge (Sr.Dn), Ramanagaram, partly decreeing the suit for recovery of money. This Regular First Appeal coming on for Hearing this day, the Court delivered the following: JUDGMENT It is the defendants' appeal. The present respondent as a plaintiff had instituted a suit against the present appellants arraigning them as defendants in O.S.No.195/2002, in the Court of the Principal Civil Judge (Senior Division) at Ramanagara, Bengaluru Rural District, (hereinafter for brevity referred to as `trial Court'), for recovery of a sum of `1,96,500/- (Rupees One Lakh Ninety Six Thousand Five Hundred Only), with RFA.No.708/2006 future interest at the rate of 2% per month on a sum of `1,00,000/-. After contest, the said suit came to be decreed by the judgment of the trial Court dated 07.01.2006. It is against the said judgment and decree the defendants have preferred this appeal. 2. The summary of the case of the plaintiff in the Court below is that the defendant No.1 is the husband of defendant No.2. Defendant No.1 borrowed a sum of `1,00,000/- from the plaintiff on 06.11.1998 in the presence of the witnesses for their family necessity and also for education expenses of their daughters. They executed on that day an agreement agreeing to repay the said amount with interest at the rate of 2% per month. The period for repayment of money was for four years and in that regard, the defendants hypothecated the suit property as security. Inspite of several demands and issuance of legal notice, the defendants RFA.No.708/2006 failed to repay the loan amount, as such, the plaintiff was constrained to institute the suit. 3. In response to the summons served upon them, the defendants appeared through their counsel and filed their written statement where they denied all the plaint averments. They denied that they had borrowed a sum of `1,00,000/- from the plaintiff on 06.11.1998 as loan. On the other hand, the defendants contended that their daughters are already married, as such, there was no necessity for them to borrow any amount towards their education expenses. The defendants also denied that they had executed any Hypothecation Agreement in favour of the plaintiff. On the other hand, they have stated that on 04.06.1998 the defendant No.1 had sold 24 guntas of land in Sy.No.67/2, situated in Muddapurakarenahalli Village, Bidadi Hobli, Ramanagaram Taluk, to the plaintiff. Taking undue RFA.No.708/2006 advantage of the said transaction, the plaintiff had fabricated the agreement dated 06.11.1998. They further stated that they are in no way liable to pay any amount to the plaintiff as alleged. 4. Based on the pleadings of the parties, the trial Court framed the following issues: 1. Does the plaintiff prove that the defendants borrowed amount as alleged? 2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled for suit claim? 3. What Order or Decree? The plaintiff got himself examined as PW-1 and got examined Sri Chaluvaiah, Sri K.V. Thimmaiah, Sri K.T. Thimmaiah and Sri B.S.Krishna Murthy in his support as PWs-2, 3 and 4 respectively. He got marked the documents from Exs.P-1 to P-4. Defendant No.1 got himself examined as D.W.1 and certified copy of the RFA.No.708/2006 Sale Deed dated 04.06.1998 was marked as Ex.D-1 from the defendents' side. After hearing for both side, the trial Court by its impugned judgment and decree dated 07.01.2006 answered issue No.1 in the affirmative and issue No.2 partly in the affirmative and partly decreed the suit holding that the defendants shall pay the plaintiff a sum of `1,96,250/- (Rupees One Lakh Ninety Six Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Only) with interest at the rate of 6% per annum on a sum of `.1,00,000/- from the date of the suit till the date of realisation. It is against the said judgment and decree the defendants have preferred this appeal. 5. Lower Court records were called for and the same are placed before this Court. RFA.No.708/2006 6. Heard the arguments of the learned counsel from both side and perused the materials placed before this Court. 7. For the sake of convenience, the parties would be referred to as per their ranks before the trial Court. 8. The learned counsel for the appellants in his argument submitted that Ex.P-1 though is an unregistered document, still, a father cannot alienate or hypothecate minors' property. As such, the Agreement of Hypothecation at Ex.P-1 would not hold good. He further submitted that the plaintiff not taking any action for the alleged non-payment of interest for a period of nearly four years would also go to show the conduct of the plaintiff and creates a doubt in his case. He also stated that the suit is barred by limitation which the trial Court has failed to consider in its proper perspective. RFA.No.708/2006 9. Learned counsel for the respondent/plaintiff in her argument submitted that the defendants though have denied the execution of the Agreement at Ex.P-1, but, the evidence of PW-1 to PW-4, among them, PWs.2 to 4 are the witnesses to the execution of the agreement by the defendants, clearly proves the execution of the Agreement at Ex.P-1 by the defendants. She further submits that the Agreement in Ex.P-1 is an agreement creating charge against the property mentioned therein, however, since it evidences the loan transaction, the said agreement, which is unregistered, can be relied upon for its collateral purpose for proving the loan transaction. In her support, she relied upon several judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court and Coordinate Benches of this Court which would be referred to at the appropriate stage herein afterwards. RFA.No.708/2006 Learned counsel for the respondent/plaintiff further submitted that the limitation attracts in this case is not under Article 19 of the Limitation Act, 1963, but, it is under Article 55 of the same Act. As such, the limitation commences once there is breach of repayment as agreed to under the agreement. 10. In the light of the above, the only point that arise for my consideration is : \\\" Whether the judgment and decree under appeal requires an interference at the hands of this Court.\\\" As observed above, the appellants though have prayed for setting aside the impugned judgment and decree, in their arguments, confined only in questioning that the defendants could not have executed Ex.P-1. Further the said document was also a compulsorily registrable document since it creates charge, as such, RFA.No.708/2006 the trial Court ought not to have considered the document. However, the learned counsel for the appellants had made it clear that, he would not dispute on the question of execution of Ex.P-1 by the defendants and would not challenge the finding of the trial Court in that regard. When the evidence of the witnesses on the side of the plaintiff is perused, it go to show that the plaintiff, as PW-1, has reiterated the contentions of his plaint in his examination-in-chief filed in the form of affidavit evidence. He has stated clearly in his examination-in- chief that the schedule property belongs to the defendants and both the defendants jointly for their family necessities and for the education purpose of their children, had availed a loan of `1 lakh from him on 6.11.1998 and it is in that regard, they have executed the document at Ex.P-1, creating a charge against the property. He has got marked the said document at Ex.P-1. RFA.No.708/2006 11. In his cross-examination, interestingly, the defendants have not denied the execution of Ex.P-1 by them. It was only suggested to the witness that on 4.6.1998, the plaintiff had purchased 24 guntas of land in Survey No.67/2 and 27 guntas of land in Survey No.67/1, from defendant No.1, for a sum of `1,27,500/- and out of the said sale consideration, only a sum of `27,500/- was paid. The balance amount of `1 lakh was promised to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendants. Subsequently, the plaintiff took the signatures of the defendants on a blank paper. PW-1 admitted that on 4.6.1998, he purchased the lands, as suggested to him, in Survey No.67/2 and Survey No.67/1, from defendant No.1, for a valuable consideration. However, he denied that he has still remained with payment of a balance of sale consideration of `1 lakh to the defendants with regard to the said transaction and that he had obtained signatures of the defendants in blank paper. Thus, the RFA.No.708/2006 defendants without denying that they have got executed Ex.P-1, have merely suggested that plaintiff had obtained their signatures on blank paper, which the plaintiff has denied. By the said mere suggestion, it cannot be inferred that the defendants have not executed Ex.P-1. Otherwise, they would have specifically suggested to PW-1 that they have not executed Ex.P-1 and have not received the consideration mentioned in the said document. Further, it also cannot be ignored of the fact that Ex.P-1 is a document executed not on any white paper, but, it is on stamp paper, which stamp paper is shown to have purchased on 17.10.1998. Admittedly, even according to the defendants and if their version is believed, they have subscribed their signature on blank paper on 4.6.1998 when they said to have sold some RFA.No.708/2006 portion of the immovable property to the plaintiff. If that were to be the case, the question of the plaintiff getting a stamp paper of a specific date which is more than four months thereafter would not arise. As such, on the very basis of it, the alleged defence of the defendants that the plaintiff has obtained their signature on a blank paper would not sustain. 12. In addition to the above, when the evidence of PWs.2, 3 and 4 is perused, it reveals that PW-2 K.V.Thimmaiah and PW-3-K.T.Thimmaiah, have deposed to the effect that the loan transaction between the plaintiff and defendants had taken place in their presence and execution of the document at Ex.P-1 was also in their presence. Both of them have identified their signatures as witnesses in Ex.P-1. RFA.No.708/2006 In their cross-examination, nothing was elicited from them which makes their evidence in examination- in-chief unbelievable. On the other hand, a mere denial suggestion made to them that no such loan transaction was taken place between the parties has been denied by both the witnesses. 13. PW-4 - B.S.Krishnamurthy, has stated that he had been the scribe of the document at Ex.P-1. He has stated that it was got written through him. Even in his cross-examination also, nothing could be elicited, except suggesting to him that he was not instructed to write the document and that the defendants were not present when the same was written. However, the witness has not admitted the said suggestion as true. 14. The defendant No.1 - Ramanna, who got himself examined as DW-1 has nowhere stated that he has executed the document at Ex.P.1 on 6.11.1998. RFA.No.708/2006 However, he has only stated that on the said day, the defendants did not avail the loan of `1 lakh from the plaintiff. On the contrary, the very same witness in his cross-examination has admitted that Ex.P-1 bears the thumb marks of himself and his wife. 15. Thus, by virtue of evidence of PWs.1, 2, 3 and 4, which could not be shaken in their cross-examination, the plaintiff's evidence as PW-1 is further corroborated and established that, on the date 6.11.1998, both the defendants have jointly executed the document at Ex.P-1 in favour of the plaintiff and have availed a loan of `1 lakh from the plaintiff. The cross-examination of DW-1 also would enable the Court to come to a conclusion that the plaintiff has proved the availment of a loan of a sum of `1 lakh by the defendants on 6.11.1998. RFA.No.708/2006 16. The second question that would remain for consideration is, whether the Ex.P-1 was required to be considered as a basis for proving the alleged loan transaction between the parties. The said document which is on a stamp paper of a sum of `600/- go to show that the defendants jointly after availing a sum of `1 lakh as loan from the plaintiff, have agreed to create a charge on the immovable property shown in the said document. As such, the document is a document with respect to creation of a charge in response to a loan transaction which the executant of the document had availed from the plaintiff. Merely because the defendants have produced a certified copy of the Sale Deed dated 4.6.1998, which is marked at Ex.D-1 and which shows that some portion of the property in Survey No.67/1 and Survey No.67/2 were sold by the defendants in favour of the plaintiff, RFA.No.708/2006 by that itself, the very same defendants executing Ex.P-1 cannot suspected. The said document at Ex.P-1 since creates charge in favour of the plaintiff with respect to an immovable property, is required to be registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908. Admittedly, the said document is an unregistered document. A perusal of the evidence of PW-1, wherein the said document was marked as an exhibit, goes to show that while marking the said document, an objection was raised, however, subject to the objection for making of the said document, the same was marked. Though the said document was initially referred to in the legal notice dated 18.10.2002, issued by the plaintiff as a Deed of Hypothecation and similarly referred even in the plaint of the plaintiff also, but, a perusal of the said document go to show that nowhere the said document identifies RFA.No.708/2006 itself as a Deed of Hypothecation. On the other hand, the said document calls itself as an document creating charge and acknowledging the receipt of amount and for payment of interest. Therefore, safely the said document may be treated as not an Hypothecation Agreement. The said document since creates a charge, is a registrable document, but, admittedly it is not registered. 17. The learned counsel for the respondent in her argument while canvassing the point that merely because a document which is required to be registered is not registered would not be thrown away and the same can be relied for its collateral purpose, has relied upon some of the judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court High Court of Judicature at Madras and Coordinate Benches of this Court in her support. Those judgments are as below : RFA.No.708/2006 19 In Mattapalli Chelamayya and another -vs- Mattapalli Venkataratnam and another, reported in { (1972) 3 SCC 799}, at Paragraph-11, the Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased to observe as below : \\\" The direction to pay a sum of money which has been held due and payable by the appellants to the respondents is a direction giving effect to a liability which already existed. It does not create the liability for the first time but merely works out the liability. But the same thing cannot be said about the charge. The charge is created for the first time. The case, therefore, involves two distinct matters - one is a personal liability to pay a certain amount, and the second is an additional relief to recover that amount from the immovable property of the appellants, should they fail to pay as ordered. It is, therefore, clear that the two do not form one transaction, but two severable transactions. As pointed out long ago by Muttusami Ayyar, J., in Sambayya v. Gangayya : \\\"The test, therefore, is whether the transaction evidenced by the particular RFA.No.708/2006 instrument is single and indivisible or whether it really evidences two transactions which can be severed from each other, the one as creating an independent personal obligation and the other as merely strengthening it by adding a right to proceed against immovable property. But it should be remembered that it is not enough that there is an obligation to pay a sum of money, but that it is also necessary that the obligation should have an independent existence, and be in no way contingent or conditional on the breach of some obligation relating to immovable property created by the same instrument, for the contingency or the condition and the obligation would then be parts of one indivisible transaction\\\". In the present case the document evidences two transactions which can be severed from each other. One transaction creates an independent personal obligation to pay a certain sum of money and the other transaction namely the charge merely strengthens the first transaction by adding a right to proceed against the charged property. In our opinion, the High Court was right in directing that the second transaction with regard to the charge being a RFA.No.708/2006 severable transaction can be validly ignored and to the extent that it declares the personal obligation to pay the transaction, not being required to be compulsorily registered, the award was admissible in evidence.\\\" The very same Hon'ble Apex Court subsequently in Yellapu Uma Maheswari and another -vs- Buddha Jagadheeswararao and others, reported in { (2015) 16 SCC 787}, wherein the question of an unregistered and unstamped Partition Deed and Deed of Relinquishment was in question, was pleased to observe that the Deed of Relinquishment of right in respect of immovable property is not admissible in evidence for primary purpose of division of joint properties by metes and bounds, but, the same can be relied upon for collateral purposes of severance of title and nature of possession of various shares only if it is impounded by paying stamp duty together with penalty. RFA.No.708/2006 22 In Umde Bhojram -vs- Wadla Gangadhar, reported in CDJ 2004 APHC 097, a Single Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court with respect to Section 58 of Transfer of Property Act, 1882, and an unregistered Mortgage Deed, was pleased to observe that, an unregistered simple Mortgage Deed disclosing any covenant undertaking to discharge the liability personally by the mortgagor without reference to the mortgaged property is admissible in evidence to prove the suit debt. It was further observed that, since the suit was for recovery of money covered by the claim, the document can be marked for collateral purposes for the recovery of money. A similar view was also taken by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in T.K.Sathiyanarayanan & others -vs- S.Jaganathan, reported in CDJ 2013 MHC 2298, where the Court held that, unregistered Mortgage Deeds can be marked as exhibits for the limited extent of RFA.No.708/2006 establishing the loan transactions and such marking cannot be found fault with. A Coordinate Bench of this Court in Smt.Krishnakumari -vs- Sri K.Suresh Kumar, reported in ILR 2015 KAR 2335, though held that a possession of immovable property and an agreement is required to be compulsorily registered and the non-registration of such a document would not affect the immovable property comprised therein, however, had considered about relying on such document for collateral purposes. In that regard, it referred to a judgment of Andhra Pradesh High Court in K.Ramamoorthi -vs- C.Surendranatha Reddy, (C.R.P.No.1623/2012, dated 27.07.2012), wherein the Andhra Pradesh High Court has observed as below : \\\"i) A document, which is compulsorily registrable, but not registered, cannot be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring such RFA.No.708/2006 power. The phrase \\\"affecting the immovable property\\\" needs to be understood in the light of the provisions of Section 17(b) of the Registration Act, which would mean that any instrument which creates, declares, assigns, limits or extinguishes a right to immovable property, affects the immovable property. ii) The restriction imposed under Section 49 of the Registration Act is confined to the use of the document to affect the immovable property and to use the document as evidence of a transaction affecting the immovable property. iii) If the object in putting the document in evidence does not fall within the two purposes mentioned in (ii) supra, the document cannot be excluded from evidence altogether. iv) A collateral transaction must be independent of or divisible from a transaction to affect the property i.e., a transaction creating any right, title or interest in the immovable property of the value of rupees hundred and upwards.. RFA.No.708/2006 v) The phrase \\\"collateral purpose\\\" is with reference to the transaction and not to the relief claimed in the suit. Vii (b) An unregistered mortgage deed requiring registration may be received as evidence to prove the money debt, provided, the mortgage deed contains a personal covenant by the mortgagor to pay.\\\" From the above judgments, it is clear that even though a document pertaining to creation of charge was marked with respect to an immovable property is required to be a registered document, but, if the said document is unregistered, it cannot be totally ignored and can be considered for any collateral purposes. 18. In the instant case, the creation of charge with respect to the property mentioned in Ex.P-1 though requires the said document to be compulsorily registrable, but, a reading of the said document in its RFA.No.708/2006 entirety, clearly go to show that the defendants, as borrowers of a sum of `1 lakh from the plaintiff, have acknowledged of they borrowing the said sum from the plaintiff and have ensured to repay the said loan amount together with agreed rate of interest thereupon within four years from the date of agreement. It is to ensure the due repayment of the loan amount, a charge was offered to be created with respect to the immovable property shown therein. As such, independent of the creation of the charge, the agreement between the parties as a lender and a borrower stands established and for the said purpose, which is a collateral to the purpose of creation of charge, Ex.P-1 can be relied upon. As such, even though the learned counsel for the appellants did not canvas the said point of alleged unregistered document at Ex.P-1, still, the above analysis would clearly go to show that Ex.P-1 can be relied and acted upon for its collateral purposes. RFA.No.708/2006 19. The first leg of the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants is that, admittedly the property in Ex.P-1 since has given to the share of the minors, the defendants as parents of the minors could not have created a charge against the said property. No doubt, a reading of Ex.P-1 would go to show that the defendants have stated that the property was divided between the children, as such, the property shown in Ex.P-1 has been given up in favour of their minor daughters. It is for the educational expenses of those minor daughters, the defendants, as their natural parents, have executed the document at Ex.P-1. Here once again it can be repeated that, the aspect of whether the defendants executing the document on behalf of the minors would arise, provided the said document is taken for its primary purpose for creating charge against the said property. However, as observed above, RFA.No.708/2006 since the scope of Ex.P-1 for the present suit is confined only for its collateral purpose for repayment of the money, the other question as to whether defendant Nos.1 and 2 could create charge against the property shown therein would not arise for consideration. As such, the said argument of the learned counsel for the appellants is not acceptable. 20. The agreement at Ex.P-1 is admittedly executed on 6.11.1998, which says that the defendants have agreed to repay the loan amount together with interest thereupon at the rate of 2% per month. The period of repayment of the loan amount was fixed at four years from the date of the agreement, which was on 6.11.1998. It is in this context, learned counsel for the appellants canvassed a point in his argument that, had really the defendants executed the said agreement at Ex.P-1, then, the plaintiff would not RFA.No.708/2006 have kept quite for a long period for more than three years without claiming even the interest from the defendants. As such, the conduct of the plaintiff is questionable. Admittedly, the plaintiff has not taken any action against the defendants for the defendants not paying the interest regularly though agreed to under Ex.P-1. But, merely because the plaintiff has not taken any action for recovery of the interest agreed to be paid by the defendants periodically, by that itself, the entire agreement at Ex.P-1 cannot be suspected. This is also for the reason that, as already observed above, apart from PW-1, even PWs.2, 3 and 4 have also supported the case of the plaintiff by stating that PWs.2 and 3 are the witnesses to the said loan transaction and PW-4 was the scribe of the document. RFA.No.708/2006 Moreover, as further observed above, even DW-1 in his cross-examination also has admitted the execution of the document at Ex.P-1 by stating that himself, joined by his wife, have put their thumb marks to the said document. Thus, when the very execution of Ex.P-1 in favour of the plaintiff has stood established, the mere non-payment of the interest would not lead to such a suspicion so as to disregard or disbelieve Ex.P-1 or to exonerate the defendants from liability towards the plaintiff for repayment of the loan amount with interest thereupon. As such, the said point of argument canvassed by the learned counsel for the appellants is also not acceptable. 21. The last point of argument of learned counsel for the appellants is that the plaint is barred by limitation. According to the learned counsel for the appellants, the date of agreement as at Ex.P-1 is RFA.No.708/2006 6.11.1998 and the suit was filed in the trial Court on 11.11.2002, as such, the suit is barred by limitation under Article 19 of the Limitation Act, 1963. No doubt, Article 19 in Schedule-I of the Limitation Act mentions that the institution of a suit for recovery of money payable for the money lent is three years when the loan is made. However, learned counsel for the respondent in her arguments submitted that in the case on hand, admittedly the document at Ex.P-1 gives a period of four years for the repayment of the loan. Since the defendants have committed breach of the agreement by not repaying the loan even at the end of the fourth year from the date of the agreement, the cause of action has arisen to the plaintiff on the said date of breach, as such, the suit has been filed within the period. She further submitted that, it is Article 55 of Schedule-I of the Limitation Act which is applicable in RFA.No.708/2006 the case on hand. The said Article mentions that, in a suit for compensation for the breach of any contract, express or implied, not otherwise specifically provided in the Schedule-I, the limitation period would be three years from the date when the contract is broken or where there are successive breaches when the breach in respect of which the suit instituted occurs or where the breach is continuous from the date when the breach ceases. 22. In that regard, learned counsel for the respondent has relied upon the judgment of Allahabad High Court in Dhapai -vs- Dalla and others, reported in AIR 1970 Allahabad 206. In the said case, the plaintiff had obtained theka of fishery rights in certain tank for complete year. The defendants had agreed to pay half of theka money to the plaintiff in return of half of fishery rights in tank. The plaintiff had filed a suit for recovery RFA.No.708/2006 of amount after defendants working out their theka in respect of their share. The Court held that the suit was for recovery of amount and not for specific performance of contract, as such, it was governed by Article 115 and not Article 113 of the Schedule-I of the Limitation Act. 23. The scope of Article 113 and Article 115 of the Limitation Act was described by the Allahabad High Court at Paras 13 and 14 of the said judgment, which are reproduced here below : \\\" 13. We now proceed to consider why Art. 115 of the First Schedule to the Limitation Act should apply to the facts of the present case. Art.115 applies when there is a breach of contract and the suit is for compensation for the loss suffered by the innocent party. A breach of contract \\\"occurs where a party repudiates or fails to perform one or more of the obligations imposed upon him by the contract\\\": (vide Cheshire and Fifoot, p. 484). \\\"If one of two parties to a contract breaks the RFA.No.708/2006 obligation which the contract imposes, a new obligation will in every case arise -a right of action conferred upon the party injured by the breach\\\": (vide Anson's Law of Contract, p. 412). Admittedly in the present case there was a contract and according to the plaintiff and the findings of the Court a breach of contract had occurred inasmuch as the defendants failed to pay the stipulated amount upon the date fixed under the contract. 14. Difficulty can, however, be caused by the word \\\"compensation\\\" used in Article 115. It can be argued that the words \\\"compensation for breach of contract\\\" point rather to a claim for unliquidated damages than to the payment of a certain sum, and, therefore, where the suit is for the recovery of a specified sum, and not for the determination of unliquidated damages, this Article should not apply. In our opinion this contention would be wholly untenable because it was not accepted by this Court in the Full Bench case of Husain Ali Khan v. Hafiz Ali Khan, (1881) ILR 3 All 600 (FB) and by the Privy Council in the case of Tricomdas Cooverji Bhoja Vs. Sri Gopinath Jiu, AIR 1916 PC 182. RFA.No.708/2006 In the case of Husain Ali Khan, (1881) ILR 3 All 600 (FB), Art. 116 of Schedule II of the Limitation Act (Act 15 of 1877) was the subject of interpretation. Articles 115 and 116 of Schedule II of Act 15 of 1877 have been reproduced verbatim in the Indian Limitation Act, 1908. Article 115 deals with the breach of contracts not in writing and registered while Article 116 provided for breach of contracts in writing and registered. It is, therefore, obvious that the meaning which has to be given to the words \\\"compensation for breach of contract\\\" occurring in both the Articles will have to be the same. In Syndicate Bank -vs- Channaveerappa Beleri and others, reported in { (2006) 11 SCC 506}, at Para- 18, the Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased to observe as below : \\\" 18. Some arguments were addressed about the article of limitation that would apply in respect of a suit against the guarantors. Samuel held that in the case of refusal of a guarantor to pay the amount, the matter would RFA.No.708/2006 be governed by Article 115 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1908, which corresponds to Article 55 of the Limitation Act, 1963. One of the submission made before us was that the term \\\"compensation for breach of contract\\\" in Article 55 indicates a claim for unliqudated damages and not a claim for payment of a sum certain as to what is the difference between a claim for unliquidated damages and a claim for a sum certain or a sum presently due, reference can advantageously be made to the classic statement of law by Chagla, C.J., in Iron and Hardware (India) Co. v. Firm Shamlal & Bros. If Article 55 does not apply, then a claim against a guarantor in such a situation may fall under the residuary Article 113 of the Limitation Act, 1963 corresponding to Article 120 of the old Act. The controversy about the appropriate article applicable, when the claim is found to be not exactly for \\\"compensation\\\" but ascertained sum due has been referred to as long back as in 1916 in Tricomdas Cooverji Bhoja v. Gopinath Jiu Thakur. Under the old Limitation Act (Act of 1908), the periods prescribed were different under Articles 115 and 116. The period prescribed were also different under Articles RFA.No.708/2006 115 and 120. But under the 1963 Act, the period of limitation is the same (three years) both under Articles 55 and 113. Having regard to the fact that the period of limitation is 3 years both under Article 55 and Article 113, and having regard to the binding decision in Samuel, we do not propose to examine the controversy as to whether the appropriate article is 55 or 113. Suffice it to note that even if the article applicable is Article 113, the Bank's suit is in time. In the light of the above judgment, when Ex.P-1 is perused, it clearly go to show that the defendants had agreed for the four years time for the repayment of the loan amount. Though the loan amount was specified, but, the period for repayment was fixed at four years. As such, the defendants had a time up to four years from the date of the alleged execution of the agreement for repaying the said loan amount and the interest thereupon. Once they commit any breach for payment of the said amount at the end of four years, the plaintiff RFA.No.708/2006 gets a cause of action to sue for recovery of the loan amount from the defendants. As such, the arisal of cause of action for the plaintiff in the case on hand is not necessarily the date of alleged agreement, but also the date when the breach of performance on the part of the defendants has occurred. Since the legal notice at Ex.P-2 go to show that plaintiff after waiting for a considerable period as per the agreement to enable the defendants to repay the loan amount, has finally issued a legal notice to them on 18.10.2002, calling upon the defendants to repay the loan amount and since the defendants have not responded to the said notice and not even repaid the loan amount, the plaintiff gets a cause of action as per Ex.P-1 to treat that the defendants have committed breach of agreement towards the repayment of the loan amount with interest thereupon and has thus instituted a suit without wasting any further time. As such, the contention of the RFA.No.708/2006 appellants that the suit was barred by limitation is also not acceptable. 24. Barring the above, the appellants have not raised any other contention in their memorandum of appeal and in the argument which are worth to be considered. As observed above, since the plaintiff by leading cogent evidence, both oral and documentary, has proved that the defendants have borrowed a sum of `1 lakh from him on 6.11.1998, agreeing to repay the same with agreed rate of interest thereupon and have committed default and have failed to repay the loan amount with interest, the plaintiff is entitled for recovery of the said sum. 25. The trial Court since has passed a considered and reasoned order decreeing the suit in-part after appreciating the materials placed before it in its proper RFA.No.708/2006 perspective, I do not find any reason to interfere in the said judgment and decree. 26. Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following order: ORDER The Appeal is dismissed. The judgment and decree dated 7.1.2006, passed by the learned Prl.Civil Judge (Sr.Dn.), Ramanagaram, in O.S.No.195/2002, is confirmed. The Registry is directed to transmit a copy of this judgment along with lower Court records to the lower Court without delay.

The factory manufactures urea for which the main raw material is Naptha, which has to be transported from the Koyali Refinery of the Indian oil Corporation. Before the actual setting up of the factory, the appellant requested the Railway Board by letter for a concessional frieght rate for the carriage of Naptha to the factory. The Railway Board by its letter EX 5 dated November 5, 1966, quoted station to station rate equal to 85-B (special) as against the rate equivalent to classification 62.5-B requested for by the appellant, and also stated that as the special rate was being quoted ahead of the actual setting up of the factory, the frieght rate would be reviewed when the traffic actually began to move. When the factory was almost ready for operation, the appellant again requested the Railway Board by letter for charging the rate under classification 62-5-B instead of 85- B (special) quoted by it. The Railway Board refused to oblige. The appellant wrote another letter to the Board, requesting it to permit charging the rate equivalent to 85-B (special) pending its final decision, as the movement of naptha was to commence from June/July, 1968. The Railway Board refused to grant that request also, saying that it could reconsider the question if on the basis of the facts and figures of the cost of production vis-a-vis the sale price of the fertilizers, it could be established that the production of the fertilisers at Kota was uneconomical unless freight concession on the movement of naptha was granted. The appellant filed a complaint under section 41(1)(a) and (b) of the Railways Act, 1890, before the Railway Rates Tribunal. The Tri- 384 bunal decided against the appellant. Aggrieved, the appellant appealed to this Court by special leave for relief against the order and judgment of the Tribunal. Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: Three questions arise for consideration of the Court: (1) whether the Railway Board was bound to allow the concessional rate offered to the appellant, that is, 85-B (special) quoted in its letter Ex. C 5 dt. November 5, 1966, to the appellant, (2) whether the rate charged for the carriage of the naptha between the stations concerned was unreasonable, and (3) whether the Railways were showing undue preference or advantage in respect of other traffic in contravention of the provisions of section 28 of the Railways Act. [389E-F ] Dealing with the third question first, which relates to the contravention of section 28 of the Railways Act, the scope of the section was considered by this Court in Rajgarh Jute Mills Ltd v. Eastern Railway and another, [1959] SCR 236 at 241, and the Railway Rates Tribunal, considering the material on record in the light of the decision of the Court in case, held that there was no evidence produced by the appellant to justify any grievance under section 28. This conclusions is perfectly justified. [390E; 391C] The second question above-said relates to the rate charged by the Railway Administration being per se unreasonable. Even assuming, as argued by appellant's counsel, that the Railways are earning some surplus income, that by itself is no ground to hold that the frieght charged is per se unreasonable. In the case of commodities of national needs such as foodgrains, crude oil etc., it may be necessary for the Railways to charge below the operation cost, and to offset the loss, the Railways may charge higher freight for some other classified commodities. The cost of operation cannot by itself be the basis for judging the reasonableness of the rate charged. Counsel for the appellant also argued that crude oil and naptha were comparable commodities for the purpose of carriage but there was disparity in the rates charged in respect of the two, naptha being charged at a much higher rate. The Tribunal rejected the demand of the appellant for parity in frieghts, and the Court cannot interfere with the finding to the Tribunal in this appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution. On merits also, there is no justification to demand that neptha should take the same freight rate as that of the crude oil. [391D, F-H; 392B. D-E] 385 Lastly, the first question: It relates to the correctness of the view taken by the Tribunal on doctrine of promissory estoppel consequent upon the letter Ex. 5 of the Railway Board. The Tribunal rejected this claim of the appellant. Considering the conclusion of the Tribunal on this question, it appears the Tribunal has not correctly understood the doctrine of promissory estoppel: The party asserting the estoppel must have relied and acted upon the assurance given to him. It means the party has changed or altered the position by relying on the assurance or representation. The alteration of position by the party is the only indispensable requirement of the doctrine. It is not necessary to prove further any damage, detriment or prejudice to the party asserting the estoppel. \\\"A promise intended to be binding, intended to be acted upon, and in fact acted upon, is binding\\\", said Lord Denning, sitting as a trial judge in Central London Properties Ltd v. High trees House Ltd., [1947] K.B. 130. If the promisee has acted upon the promise, the promisor is precluded from receding from his promise. The concept of detriment as it is understood now is whether it appears unjust, unreasonable or inequitable that the promisor should be allowed to resile from his assurance or representation, having regard to what the promisee has done or refrained from doing in reliance on the assurance or representation. It is, however quite fundamental that the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be used to compel the public bodies or The Government to carry out the representation or promise which is contrary to law or which is outside their authority or power. Secondly, the estoppel stems from equitable doctrine. it requires that he who seeks equity must do equity. The doctrine, therefore, cannot also be invoked if it is found to be inequitable or unjust in its enforcement. or the purpose of invoking the doctrine, it is not necessary for the appellant to show that the insurance contained in Ex. (I S was mainly responsible for the establishing of the factory at Kota. There may be several representation to one party from different authorities in regard to different matters. Or there may be several representations from the same party in regard to different matters; In the instant case, there was one representation by the Rajasthan government to supply power to the appellant's factory at concessional rate. There is another representation from the same government to exempt the appellant from payment of tax for a certain period. If those representations have been relied upon by the appellant, the Court would compel the authorities to adhere to their representations. What is required is the fact that the appellant was induced to act on the representations. The assurance given by the Railway Board in the letter Ex. S was not clear and unqualified. it was subject to review to be undertaken 386 when the appellant started moving the raw material. Accordingly, A appellant was put to notice that it has to approach the Railway administration again when it would review the whole matter. From the tenor of Ex. 5, the railways are entitled to say that they have reviewed the matter and found no justification for a concessional frieght rate for naptha; that does not amount to resiling from the earlier assurance. No question of estoppel arises in favour of the appellant in the case out of the representation made in Ex 5. The Court agreed with the conclusion of the Tribunal but not for all the reasons stated.

JUDGMENT: CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 223 of 1974. From the Judgment and order dated 13.7.1973 of the Railways Rates Tribunal, Madras in Complaint No. 2 of 1969. K.K. Jain, Bishamber Lal, Pramod Dayal and A.D. Sanger for the Appellant. Bed Brat Barua, Ms. A. Subhashini,.C.V. Subba Rao, Mrs. S. Suri, P. Parmeswaran and Anil Katiyar for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNATHA SHETTY, J. This appeal, with Special Leave, is against the order and judgment dated July 13, 1973, of the Railways Rates Tribunal Madras, in complaint filed by the appellant under Section 41(1) of the Indian Railways Act No. 9 of 1890. The background facts are these: The appellant is a Company. It has set up a fertilizer factory at Kota in Rajasthan. It is said to be an industrially backward area. The factory manufactures Urea for which the main raw material is Naptha. Naptha has to be transported from Koyali Refinery of Indian oil Corporation. The nearest railway station is Bajuva near Baroda. The nearest railway station serving Company's factory is Dadhevi in Rajasthan. The distance between Bajuva and Dadhevi is about 520 kms. For transportation, the Naptha has been classified by the Railway under Clause 110-B of the tariff. Before the actual setting up of the factory, the Company, by its letter dated September 5, 1966 requested the Railway Board for a concessional frieght rate for the carriage of Naptha. It requested the Railway Board for fixed Station to Station rate equivalent to classification 62.5-B. That would have meant reduction of about 43% in the normal tariff under clause 110-B. In that letter it was pointed out that if such concessional rate was not fixed, the Company would be put to disadvantageous position as against the other factories located at ports or near the refineries. The Railway Board by its letter Ex. C5 dated November 5, 1966 agreed to quote station to station rate equal to 85-B (Special). In the said letter it was also stated that as the special rate was being quoted ahead of the actual setting up of the factory the freight rate need to be reviewed when the traffic actually begins to move. When the factory was almost ready for operation the company wrote a letter dated June 5, 1967 requesting the Railway Board for charging the rate under classification 62.5-B instead of 85-B(Special). The Railway Board did not accede to the request. On May 31, 1968 the company wrote another letter informing the Railway Board that the movement of Naptha would commence from June/July 1968 and pending decision of the company's earlier request, the Railway Board may permit charging the rate equivalent to 85-B (Special) already offered in terms of the letter Ex. 5. The Railway Board refused to grant that request also. The Railway Board, however, informed the Company in the letter dated July 11, 1968 as follows: \\\"However, if on the basis of facts and figures your cost of production (date to be furnished for at least one complete year) vis-a-vis the sale price of fertilizers, it can be established that production of fertilizers at Kota is uneconomical, until freight concession on the movement of Naptha from Bajuva/Trombay to Kota is granted, the Railway Board would be prepared to reconsider the question.\\\" on April 19, 1969, the company filed a complaint under Section 41(1)(a) and (b) of the Railways Act, 1890 before the Railway Rates Tribunal Madras. The principal contentions raised in the complaint are as follows: \\\"(i) The Railway Board was estopped and/or precluded from going back on the assurance Of quoting station to station concessional rate 85-B when the company had in vested a large amount of capital in setting up the factory at a place away from the refinery or port (ii) The rate charges by the Railway for the carriage of Naptha between two stations-Bajuva and Dadhevi was unreasonable under Section 41(1)(b) of the Indian Railways Act, 1980, and (iii) The Railways were showing undue preference or advantage in respect of other traffic and contravening the provisions of Section 28 of the Indian Railway Act, 1890.\\\" With these and other contentions, the company requested the tribunal to declare the rate charged for the carriage of Naptha as unreasonable and to fix a reasonable rate for such carriage. The Railway Board in its reply maintained that while quoting the concessional rate equal to 85-B (Special) it was made clear to the company that the rate was subject to review when the traffic starts moving and that concessional rate was provisional in character. The company did not construct the factory relying solely on the concessional rate offered by the Railway Board. There was no scope for any such understanding since the Railway reserved its right to determine the correct rate when the traffic started moving. It was later found that the chemicals have been advisedly given low class rate with a view to encourage fertilizer industry and no further concession was necessary to the company. It was further stated that the question of any undue prejudice of undue favour to any party does not arise when charging the respective class rates for specified commodities. On these pleadings the Tribunal considered among others, the following issues: 1. Whether freight charges, now charged, for the carriage of a Company's traffic in Neptha from Bajuva to Dadhevi station are unreasonable under Section 41(1) of the Indian Railways Act, 1890? 2. Whether the Railways are contravening Section 28 of the Indian Railways Act in charging the respective class rates for commodities naptha, chemical manures, divisions A & B, Urea and Gypsum? 3. Whether the Railways are estopped by the doctrine of promissory estoppel in view of the assurance given in the letter Ex. C? The Tribunal determined all these questions against the company. It was held that there was no unreasonableness in the rate charged for the carriage of Naptha from Bajuva to Dadhevi. The Railways are not contravening Section 28 of the Railways Act. The rate charged has not caused any prejudice to the company. On the question of promissory estoppel, the Tribunal held that the assurance given by the Railway Board in the letter Ex. C5 was not mainly responsible for setting up of fertilizer factory at Kota. It was further held that even if Ex. CS was an assurance to the Company the withdrawal of that assurance has not adversely affected the interests of the company. Upon the submissions made by learned counsel on both sides, the following questions arise for our consideration: (1) Whether the Railway Board was bound to give the concessional rate offered to the company under Ex. C5 dated November 5, 1966? (2) Whether the rate charged for the carriage of Naptha between Bajuva and Dadhevi is unreasonable? (3) Whether the Railways are showing undue preference or advantage in respect of other traffic and contravening the provisions of Section 28 of the Railways Act? We may conveniently take up third question first for consideration. The relevant provisions of the Railways Act, 1890, which have a material bearing on the question are these: Section 41 provides for filing complaints against Railway Administration. The Section provides as follows, so far as it is material: 41(I) Any complaint that a railway administration (a) is contravening the provisions of Section 28 or (b) is charging for the carriage of any commodity between two stations a rate which is unreasonable, or (c) x x x x x may be made to the Tribunal and the Tribunal shall hear and decide any such complaint in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Section 28 provides: \\\"28. A Railway administration shall not make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to, or in favour of, any particular person or railway administration, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect what soever, or subject any particular person or railway administration or any particular description of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever. \\\" The third question formulated by us relates, to the contravention of Section 28 of the Railways Act. The scope of this Section has been considered by this Court in Rajgarh Jute Mills Ltd v Eastern Railway and another, [ 1959] SCR 236 at 241. There it was observed that a party who complains against the railway administration that the provisions of Section 28 have been contravened must establish that there has been preference between himself and his goods on the one hand and his competitor and his goods on the other. Gajendragadkar, J. (as he then was) observed: \\\"Section 28 is obviously based on the principle that the power derived from the monopoly of railway carriage must be used in a fair and just manner in respect of all persons and all descriptions of traffic passing over the railway area. In other words, equal charges should normally be levied against persons or goods of the same or similar kinds pas sing over the same or similar area of the railway lines and under the same or similar circumstances; but this rule does not mean that, if the railway administration charges un- equal rates in respect of the same or similar class of goods travelling over the same or similar areas, the inequality of rates necessarily attract the provisions of S. 28. All cases of unequal rates cannot necessarily be treated as cases of preference because the very concept of preference postulates competition between the person of traffic receiving preference and the person or traffic suffering prejudice in consequence. It is only as between competitors in the same trade that a complaint of preference can be made by one in reference to the other.\\\" In the light of these principles, the Tribunal considering the material on record held that there is no evidence produced by the Company to justify any grievance under Section 28. We see no reason to disagree with this conclusion. It is, in our opinion, perfectly justified. In fact Mr. K.K. Jain learned counsel for the appellant also did not seriously dispute the correctness of that finding recorded by the Tribunal. We may now turn to the second question.Mr. K.K. Jain urged that the rate charged by the Railway Administration is per se unreasonable. Here again the onus to prove the alleged unreasonableness of the freight rests on the company. It is for the company to establish that the rate charged by the Railway Administration for the carriage of Naptha is unreasonable. Of course, this onus could be discharged by relying upon the material produced by the Railways. Mr. Jain, therefore, relied upon a statement Ex. C46 in support of his case. Ex. C46 is a statement of surplus \\\"working cost\\\" in respect of carriage of Naptha from Bajuva to Dadhevi. It is, in our opinion, not necessary to analyse the statement. Even assuming that the railways are earning some surplus income after deducting the operation cost that by itself is no ground to hold that the freight charged is per se unreasonable. It must be born in mind that the railways are run as commercial undertaking and at the same time it being an instrumentality of the State, should serve the national interest as well. There is however, no obligation on the railways to pass on the extra amount realised by the carriage of goods to customers. Nor it is necessary to share the profit with the commuters. As Mr. Barua learned counsel for the Railways said that in the case of commodities of national needs such a foodgrains, crude oil etc., it may be necessary for the Railways to charge below the operation cost. To off set such a loss the Railways may charge higher freight for certain other classified commodities. Therefore, it seems to us, that the cost of operation cannot by itself be the basis for judging the reasonableness of the rate changed. It was next urged by Mr. K.K. Jain that the crude oil and Naptha are considered as comparable commodities for the purpose of carriage. The crude oil carries the rate equal to class 85-B(old), 85(new) while Naptha carries rate 110- B(old), 105-B(new). In terms of amounts it works out at Rs.59.45 for crude oil as against Rs.73.13 for Naptha. The counsel urged that there is no justification shown for this wide disparity in the first place. Secondly, the freight rate of crude oil was the rate offered to the company under Ex. CS and the denial of that rate without any good reason is arbitrary. This argument though attractive does not carry conviction if one analyses the evidence on record. Crude oil has been clubbed with Glycerine, fruit juices and syrups, fibres, flax etc. Naptha has been clubbed with Aviation Spirit, Petrol, Petroleum, Ether and solvent oil. From the evidence produced by the Railways Naptha has been classified as a dangerous commodity with the flash point below 24.4\\u00f8C spontaneously. The crude oil has no such dangerous characteristics. It is also on record that Naptha requires special type of tank wagons and the Railways have to take special precautions for transportation. These and other relevant factors have been taken into account by the Tribunal for rejecting the demand of the company for parity in freights. This Court cannot, interfere with such a finding in this appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution. On the merits also, we see no justification to demand that Neptha should take the same freight rate as that of crude oil. We may now revert to the first question. It relates to the correctness of the view taken by the Tribunal on the doctrine of promissory estoppel resulting by the letter Ex. CS of the Railway Board. The Tribunal has rejected this claim of the company by summarising its conclusion in the following terms: \\\"We must, therefore, hold that the assurance contained in . Ext. CS was not mainly responsible for the setting up of the Fertilizer Factory at Kota. 15.3. Even if it was held that Ex. CS was a definite encouragement to the complainant to set up the Kota factory, there is no evidence on record to show that the withdrawal of the concession by Ex. 12 has adversely affected the complainant. We will show in the (i succeeding paragraphs that the complainant has suffered no material injury by virtue of the withdrawal of the concessional rate and the charging of the normal rate. It is well settled that the principle of estoppel cannot be applied unless the person pleading estoppel can show that he has been prejudiced by the conduct of the party on whose assurance l l he has acted.\\\" Here the Railways Rates Tribunal apparently, appears to have gone off the track. The doctrine of promissory estoppel has not been correctly understood by the Tribunal. It is true, that is the formative period, it was generally said that the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked by the promisee unless he has suffered 'detriment' or 'prejudice'. It was often said simply, that the party asserting the estoppel must have been induced to act to his detriment. But this has now been explained in so many decisions all over. All that is now required is that the party asserting the estoppel must have acted upon the assurance given to him. Must have relied upon the representation made to him. It means, the party has changed or altered the position by relying on the assurance or the representation. The,alteration of position by the party is the only indispensable requirement of the doctrine. It is not necessary to prove further any damage, detriment or prejudice to the party asserting the estoppel. The Court, however, would compel the opposite party to adhere to the representation acted upon or abstained from acting. The entire doctrine proceeds on the promise that it is reliance based and nothing more. This principle would be clear if we study the cases in which the doctrine has been applied even since it was burst out into sudden blaze in 1946. Lord Denning in Central London Properties Ltd v High Trees House Ltd, 11947] K.B. 130 sitting as a trial judge, asserted: \\\"A promise intended to be binding, intended to be acted upon, and in fact acted upon is binding ....... The history of the High Trees principle is too well known to bear repetition. It will be enough to make the following points. The promisor is bound because he led the promisee to commit himself to change the position. If the promisee has acted upon the promise, the promisor is. precluded from receding his promise. No further detriment to the promisee upon his temporal interests need be established. This position has been made clear by Lord Denning himself in his article \\\"Recent Developments in the Doctrine of Consideration\\\" Modern Law Review, Vol. 15 at p. 5. \\\"A man should keep his word. All the more so when the promise is not a bare promise but is made with the intention that the other party should act upon it. Just a contract is different from tort and from estoppel, so also in the sphere now under discussion promises may give rise to a different equity from other conduct. The difference may lie in the necessity of showing \\\"detriment\\\" where one party deliberately promises to waive, modify or discharge his strict legal rights, intending the other party to act on the faith of promise, and the other party actually does act on it, then it is contrary, not only to equity but also to good faith, to allow the promisor to go back on his promise. It should not be necessary for the other party to show that he acted to his detriment in reliance on the promise. It should be sufficient that he acted on it. The principle governing this branch of the subject cannot be better put then in the wolds of a great Australian jurist, DIXON, J. in Grundt v The Great Boulder Pty Gold Mines Ltd, [1938] 59 CLR 641. There he said: \\\"It is often said simply that the party asserting the estoppel must have been induced to act to his detriment. Although substantially such a statement is correct and leads to no misunderstanding, it does not bring out clearly the basal purpose of the doctrine. That purpose is to avoid or pre vent a detriment to the party asserting the estoppel by compelling the opposite party to adhere to the assumption upon which the former acted or abstained from acting. This means that the real detriment or harm from which the law seeks to give protection is that which would flow from the change of position if the assumption were deserted that led to it. So long as the assumption is adhered to, the party who altered his situation upon the faith of it cannot complain. His complaint is that when afterwards the other party makes a different state of affairs the basis of an assertion of right against him then, if it is allowed, his own original change of position will operate as a detriment. His action or inaction must be such that if the assumption upon which he proceeded were shown to be wrong, and an inconsistent state of affairs were accepted as the foundation of the rights and duties of himself and the opposite party, the consequence would be to make his original act or failure to act a source of prejudice.\\\" This passage was referred to, with approval, by Lord Denning in Central Newbury Car Auction Ltd v Unity Finance Ltd, [1956] 3 All E.R. 905 at 909. The said passage has also been quoted, with approval, by Bhagwati, J. (as he then was) in Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co A Ltd v state of U.P. & Ors.,[ 1979]2 SCR 641 at p. 695= 1979(2)SCC 409. The learned Judge then said: \\\"We do not think that in order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel it is necessary for the promisee to show that he suffered detriment as a result of acting in reliance on the promise. But we may make it clear that if by detriment we mean injustice to the promisee which could result if the promisor were to recede from his promise then detriment would certainly come in as a necessary ingredient. The detriment in such a case is not some prejudice suffered by the promisee by acting on the promise, but the prejudice which would be caused to the promisee, if the promisor were allowed to go back on the promise. \\\" The view taken in Motilal Padmapat Sugar Mills case (supra) has been reiterated in Union of India & Ors. v. Godfrey Philips India Ltd,, [ 1985 ] 4 SCC 369 = [ 1985 ] Supp 3 SCR 123 . The concept of detriment as we know understand is whether it appears unjust, unreasonable or inequitable that the promisor should be allowed to resile from his assurance or representation, having regard to what the promisee has done or refrained from doing in reliance on the assurance or representation. It is, however, quite fundamental that the doctrine of promissory estoppel, cannot be used to compel the public bodies or the Government to carry out the representation or promise which is contrary to law or which is outside their authority or power. Secondly, the estoppel stems from equitable doctrine. It, therefore, requires that he who seeks equity must do equity. The doctrine, therefore, cannot, also be invoked if it is found to be inequitable or unjust in its enforcement. We may also state that for the purpose of invoking the doctrine, it is not necessary for the company to show that the assurance contained in Ex.C5 was mainly responsible for establishing the factory at Kota. There may be several representations to one party from different authorities in regard to different matters. Or, there may be several representations from the same party in regard to different matters. As in the instant case, there was one representation by the Rajasthan Government to supply power to the company at concessional rate. There was another representation from the same Govern- ment to exempt the company from payment of tax for certain period. There may be other representations from the same or some other authorities. If those representations have been relied upon by the company, the Court would compel those parties to adhere to their respective representations. It is immaterial whether each of the representations was wholly responsible or partly responsible for locating the factory at Kota. It is sufficient if the company was induced to act on that representation. The last and final aspect of the matter to which attention should be drawn is that for the purpose of finding whether an estoppel arises in favour of the person acting on the representation, it is necessary to look into the whole of the representation made. It is also necessary to state that the representation must be clear and unambiguous and not tentative or uncertain. In this context we may usefully refer to the following passage from Halsbury's Laws of England, Halsbury's Laws of England 4th Edn. Vol. 16 p. 1071 para 1595. \\\"1595. Representation must be unambiguous To found an estoppel a representation must be clear and unambiguous, not necessarily susceptible of only one interpretation, but such as will reasonably be understood by the person to whom it is made in the sense contended for, and for this purpose the whole of the representation must be looked at. This is merely an application of the old maxim applicable to all estoppels, that they \\\"must be certain to every intent The question now is whether the assurance given by the Railway Board in the letter Ex.C5 was clear and unqualified. But unfortunately, it is not so. It was subject to review to be undertaken when the company starts moving the raw material. Ex. C5 reads:- New Delhi I, Dated S Nov., 1966 Dear Sir, Sub: Integrated Fertilizer-PVC project at Kota, Rajasthan Rail movement of Naptha. Ref: Your letter No. SFC/Gen-72 dated 5.9.1966 I am directed to state that the Railway Board agree to quote a special rate equal o class 85-B (Special) CC: K for transport of Naptha in train loads from Bombay or Koyali to Kota, for manufacture of fertilizers. The proposed special rate will apply at owner's risk. Since the special rate is being quoted ahead of the actual setting up of the factory the rate may need to be reviewed when the traffic actually begins to move. The Railway may accordingly be approached before the traffic actually starts moving. Yours faithfully, Sd/- R.L. Sharma for Secretary Railway Board\\\" What does this letter mean? The first part of the letter offering the concessional rate equal to class 85-B (Special) has been completely watered down in the second part of the letter. It has been expressly stated that the rate may need be reviewed when the traffic actually begins to move. The company was put to notice that it has to again approach the Railway Administration. The Railway authorities now states that they have reviewed the whole matter and found no justification to offer a concessional freight rate for Naptha, since fertilizers are deliberately given a low classification in the tariff. From the tenor of Ex. S the Railways are entitled to state so, and it does not amount to resiling from the earlier assurance. No question of estoppel arises in favour of appellant out of the representation made in Ex. CS. We, therefore, agree with the conclusion of the Tribunal but not for all the reasons stated. In the result the appeal fails and is dismissed. In the circumstances. however, we make no order as to costs. S.L.
